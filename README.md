# Simple Login System

A minimal Python-based login system that demonstrates basic username and password authentication.

## Description

This project is a simple command-line login system built with Python. It validates user credentials against predefined values and grants or denies access accordingly. While lightweight, it can be extended to support more advanced authentication features such as multiple users, hashed passwords, or database integration.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- Standard Library only (no external dependencies)  

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-login-system.git
cd simple-login-system
```

### Executing program

Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python Simple\ Login\ System.py
```

You’ll be prompted to enter a username and password.  

- Default username: `admin`  
- Default password: `1234`  

Successful login displays:

```
Access Granted
```

Otherwise:

```
Access Denied. Please Try Again.
```

## Help

If you encounter issues:  
- Ensure you’re using Python 3.  
- Double-check spacing when entering the username/password.
